Paper Wallet in a few words:

A way to store your bitcoins as a physical object.

It’s a cold storage when the private key is generated and kept offline.

How to create it PROPERLY:

Creating a paper wallet consists roughly of generating a public/private key pair and printing it. But since we want it to be safe, here are the best practices:

Use a clean operating system, like a Linux you boot from a new USB flash drive.

Use an application that supports private key encryption.

Take your computer offline before generating the keys.

Use a printer with no network connections.

Why you might want it?

Since it’s completely offline, it protects you against network attacks.

Ideal for long-term storage, with your absolute control over the bitcoins.

It’s a nice way to give bitcoins as a gift.

It requires physical safety. Now, some may say this is a drawback, but consider this:

Time of experience we have in guarding physical stuff.

Time of experience we have in guarding digital stuff.

It allows you to have extra security with a multi-signature wallet. It goes like this:

Split your walletinto “n” pieces. You’ll need “m” of the “n” pieces to access your funds.

Hide them in safe places.

Your house

Your mama’s

The bank safe

Company building

Gollum’s cave

If malicious parties find any of the pieces - or if Bilbo decides the ring is worth less than your bitcoins...

You can still pay for your vacatoin in Fiji, because your bitcoins are still yours and you have time to redo the safety process in a new wallet.
